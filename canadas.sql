The candidate can apply through the Express Entry program and wait for getting the invitation to apply (ITA) for further rounds of Canada PR visa. This is applicable only to those candidates who have a score of 6 CLB or more on the IELTS exam and have been offered a job under FSTP conditions.<br>2. However, if a candidate possesses job offers under FSTP, but has a lower  IELTS score, is still able to apply through the offline application.<br>3. Precisely fill the information in the application form and provide all the required documents with that. Fill the form without any mistake as the governing bodies offer no second chance for revision subsequent to final submission.<br>4. The processing period is relatively shorter in the Federal government’s program so it takes less than 6 months.
